# ZachPlayer

A minimalist, mouse-only media player built for Raspberry Pi. ZachPlayer is designed for simple, distraction-free playback of music and video files with real-time CLI visuals and flexible control via mouse gestures. No keyboard required.

## Features

- âœª **Audio & Video Playback** using `cvlc`
- ðŸ”Œ **Mouse-Only Control** via `evdev` (clicks + scroll)
- ðŸ“‚ **Top Menu + Modes**:
  - **File Picker** â€“ browse and choose media manually
  - **Random Play** â€“ shuffle and loop through your playlist
- ðŸŽ¨ **Simple Terminal UI**, custom-drawn using Python (not curses)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- VLC (`cvlc`)
- `evdev` (for input handling)

## Usage

From the project directory:

```bash
python3 zachplayer.py
```

Control the player using your mouse:

| Action       | Behavior                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Left Click   | Select or play / pause               |
| Right Click  | Toggle between random & picker       |
| Scroll Wheel | Navigate list or skip 30sec in media |
| Middle Click | Return to Top Menu                   |

## Planned Features

- Not optimized for high-resolution video.
- No built-in playlist editor (random mode is automatic).
- Requires configuration to match your mouse device in `input_devices.txt`.
